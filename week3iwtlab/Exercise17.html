		<h1>Layers</h1>
		<p>The <span>transport layer</span> is responsible for process-to-process delivery of the entire message.
                   A process is an application program running on the host. Whereas the network
                   layer oversees source-to-destination delivery of individual packets, it does not recognize
                   any relationship between those packets. It treats each one independently, as though
                   each piece belonged to a separate message, whether or not it does. The transport layer,
                   on the other hand.</p> 
		<p>The <span>network layer</span> is responsible for the source-to-destination delivery of a packet,
                   possibly across multiple networks (links). Whereas the data link layer oversees the
                   delivery of the packet between two systems on the same network (link), the network
                   layer ensures that each packet gets from its point of origin to its final destination.
                   If two systems are connected to the same link, there is usually no need for a network
                   layer.
